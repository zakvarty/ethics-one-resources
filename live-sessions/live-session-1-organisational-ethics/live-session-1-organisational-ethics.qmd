# Making Information Palatable (5 mins)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Form as well as function? 

<br>

In the final few minutes, discuss the documents themselves (rather than their content).

How might the delivery of information impact on how it is recieved / acted upon? 

<br>

- How important is length?
- How important is presentation?
- Does your organisation have a similar document? 
- How does it compare?
