# Explainability Methods
  
## ICE, PDP, LIME, SHAP

In breakout rooms discuss: 

<br>

  - What does this method show? 
  
  - When might this be a good method to use? 
  
  - What are the drawbacks/limitations of this method?
  
  
## Group 1 - ICE

## Group 1 - End matter 

```{r}
countdown::countdown(5)
```

<br>

- How do the authors use the end-matter to "sell" their new work?
- What other work has been done in this area?
- What limitations does the method have? 
- How could this work be taken further?
  
## Group 2 - Methodology 
  
```{r}
countdown::countdown(5)
```

<br>

- What new methods are introduced in this paper?
- Is it clear which aspects of this are novel?
- Were there any parts that you found particularly clear or confusing?
  
  
## Group 3 - Theory / Evidence
  
```{r}
countdown::countdown(5)
```

<br>

- What simulations or theoretical results do the authors present to justify their new method?
- What data examples do they use to demonstrate their new method? 
- Do you think that these are effective, or can you think of better examples?
